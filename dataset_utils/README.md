# UTILITIES 
This directory contains code and scripts for managing, the dataset used for 
the project.

## Directory structure

```bash
.
├── core
├── hybrid_dataset
├── result_plots
└── validation

```

There are 4 main directories: core, hybrid_dataset, result_plots and validation. 

Core contains the main utilities used for preprocessing the dataset for training
and testing. hybrid_dataset has the same purpose for training and testing the 
hybrid model.

result_plots are utilities for formatting of the results and plots.
Scripts in this folder can for example combine several plots into one figure.
